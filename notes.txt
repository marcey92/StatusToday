Is there a reason for there being no measurments? 
Could it be linked to the humidity or solar power?!

Comma Delimitered

Attributes:
Rainfall = very little data - maybe faulty
Wind-Speed & Wind-Direction = Both good but after a month no reading... - fault
Surface-temp = All data - can be aggregated by day 12hr!? vs. night 12hr (not solar)
Humidity = All data
Solar flux - efectivley when was there light... can be an indicator of power/sun etc etc


TO LOOK AT:

is solar and power linked?
	- hourly break down

is surface temp related to solar?
	- hourly break down

any patterns in wind speed with direction or not?
	- Daily

does pressure change with anything?
	- Daily?

REMOVED non dates so 60*24-1=1439 row per day
