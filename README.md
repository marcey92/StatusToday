My Use Case

Your company ground is able to lease it's land January to September for speciel events. Unfortunalty due to it's location, a remote valley with a unique climate, national weather data is unabel to predict the local climate. This makes pricing the ground difficult.
A weather machine has been set up and has monitored the weather over the last year. The manager wants to stager the price of the lease by month and by the day of the week: better weather meaning a higher price.
This dashbourd allows you to view the most relevent data to make your decisions on when the price could be high or low to maximse customers and profit.
